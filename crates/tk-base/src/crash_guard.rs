//! Process-wide fatal-signal guard.
//!
//! tokenade links several native components that can SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGILL on
//! an exotic platform/libc: the bundled `sqlite-vec` C extension (ABI mismatch
//! at `sqlite3_auto_extension` time), the tree-sitter C grammars, and the
//! embedding runtime. A Rust binary that takes a fatal signal DUMPS CORE.
//!
//! Prod report (Fedora, no repro available — `core dump causing PC slowdown`):
//! a crash on EVERY hook invocation made systemd-coredump write a multi-hundred-
//! MB tokenade core per fire, dozens of times a minute, grinding the machine to
//! a halt. `std::panic::catch_unwind` does NOT help — these are signals, not
//! unwinds.
//!
//! This installs async-signal-safe handlers that, on a fatal signal:
//!   1. append a one-line breadcrumb to the debug log through a PRE-OPENED fd
//!      (raw `write(2)` only — no allocation, no lock, no Rust formatting), and
//!   2. `_exit(0)` — fail-open (tokenade's standing philosophy: when it can't
//!      run safely, get out of the agent's way) and, crucially, exit WITHOUT
//!      dumping core, so the machine stops being hammered.
//!
//! Unix-only; a no-op on other targets. Idempotent. Opt out with
//! `TOKENADE_NO_CRASH_GUARD=1` (e.g. when you actually want a core dump for
//! debugging).

/// Install the guard. Call once, as early as possible in `main`. Resolves the
/// debug-log path itself (same env var + default the logger uses) so the
/// breadcrumb lands wherever normal logs do. Safe to call when no debug log is
/// configured — the handler simply skips the breadcrumb and still prevents the
/// core dump.
/// Bytes to hand back on stdout if a fatal fault kills the process before the
/// normal path delivered them, plus the exit code to leave with.
///
/// WHY this exists rather than a `catch_unwind`: the release profile is
/// `panic = "abort"`, so **`catch_unwind` never fires in a shipped binary** — a
/// panic goes straight to `abort()`, which lands here as SIGABRT. The handler
/// answered every fault with `_exit(0)` and nothing on stdout, so a panic
/// anywhere in compaction turned `tokenade wrap '<cmd>'` into **"exit 0, no
/// output"** — a failure that reads as a command that succeeded and printed
/// nothing. That is the one outcome the product's contract rules out.
///
/// Arming with the command's ALREADY-REDACTED output makes the promise real for
/// every fatal fault, not only panics: a SIGSEGV in a bundled C extension is
/// salvaged the same way, which no unwinding scheme could do.
