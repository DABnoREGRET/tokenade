//! **The inventory of persistent stores, in one place.**
//!
//! Each one lives under `~/.tokenade/` by default and accepts an environment
//! override. They were enumerated nowhere, so each consumer
//! knew the subset it had come across.
//!
//! ## What it cost
//!
//! MEASURED 2026-09-08: the bench (`tokenade-bench::Bench`) believed itself ISOLATED and
//! only redirected **three out of five** — `TOKENADE_CONFIG_DIR`,
//! `TOKENADE_STASH_DIR`, `TOKENADE_DEDUP_DB`. The index, the fold store, the
//! file search and the semantic store stayed the
//! operator's. Hence:
//!
//! * every measurement read stores the bench believed were empty;
//! * `Bench::forget()`, written to make each capture independent,
//!   only wiped what it redirected — the guarantee was false for four
//!   stores out of five;
//! * `probe --here index` spent eighteen seconds rebuilding the machine's REAL
//!   index, from an instrument whose whole contract is to touch
//!   nothing.
//!
//! A hand-kept list is what lets the sixth slip through: a source
//! guard requires every `TOKENADE_*_DB` override in the crate to appear here.

/// A store: the variable that redirects it, and its file name under
/// `~/.tokenade/`.

/// writes that would otherwise contaminate a PRODUCTION store with rows tagged
/// to throwaway tempdirs.
///
/// It guarded the gain ledger alone for a year, and the two other stores that
/// key rows by project path were left open. Measured 2026-09-03 on a real
/// install: **85 of 180 rows in `index.db` (47 %) and 38 of 104 in
/// `semantic.db` (37 %)** were test tempdirs, the newest written that morning.
/// `tokenade semantic-status` reported 52 projects where 14 exist. The original
/// guard's comment says why this belongs at the store rather than in the harness — it
/// is "belt-and-suspenders … catches any future test helper that forgets to
/// also redirect HOME" — and a rule that lives in one place has to be CALLED
/// from every place.
///
/// Patterns covered:
/// - `…/tokenade-cli-*` (cli/main.rs `tmp()` helper)
/// - `…/tokenade-core-*` (core tests' temp helper, if any)
/// - `…/cargo-test-*` (rare but observed when tests use std::env::temp_dir
///   inside `target/tmp/...`)
///
/// We match on the basename component (not the absolute path) because the
/// system's temp_dir varies (`/tmp` on Linux, `/var/folders/...` on macOS,
/// `C:\Users\...\Temp` on Windows) but the prefix is what tests inject.
/// True when a row keyed on `project_path` would land in the USER's real
/// store because a harness redirected the working directory and not `HOME`.
///
/// `is_test_cwd` alone is too blunt for the project-keyed stores: a properly
/// isolated test redirects BOTH, so its cwd looks like a tempdir while its
/// store is its own, and refusing that write only breaks the test. The leak
/// that guard describes is precisely the asymmetry — "sets env::current_dir to a
/// tempdir but does NOT redirect HOME" — so that is what this asks. The gain
