//! **A delivered fold stays out of the context for the rest of the session.**

//! Every token a fold removes would have been re-read on every following call,
//! until compaction. `fold_rereads` counts those re-reads from the session's
//! compaction journal (`{key}-compactions.jsonl`); this module is the ONLY one
//! that deposits a measured fold there. The deposit used to be made by hand in
//! `wrap` and in the Read hook, and nowhere else: MEASURED 2026-10-08 over 14
//! days, ≈ 7.7 M tokens folded by `tokenade read`/`web`/`skeleton`, WebFetch,
//! the Read dedup, images and documents earned no re-read at all. It now
//! happens when the row is written.
