//! Screenshot-grade dashboard renderer.
//!
//! The look users see when they run `tokenade dashboard` IS the marketing
//! material for the project — people screenshot CLI dashboards and share
//! them. So this module treats the output as a brand artifact:
//!
//! - **ASCII brand block** at the top so any screenshot is unambiguously
//!   Tokenade (no confused "neat dashboard, but what tool is this?").
//! - **One hero number**: total tokens saved + % + dollar value, set in
//!   the largest visual weight on the screen so the eye lands there.
//! - **Bar charts** instead of bare percentages — humans compare lengths
//!   faster than they compare numbers.
//! - **Color** when the terminal supports it, falling back to mono when
//!   piped, when `NO_COLOR=1`, or when stdout is not a TTY. The shape of
//!   the dashboard does not depend on color.
//!
//! All rendering is pure: callers pass a [`DashboardData`] in and get a
//! `String` back. No I/O, no env reads, no time calls inside the renderer
//! — easier to unit-test, easier to embed in HTML / web exports later.
