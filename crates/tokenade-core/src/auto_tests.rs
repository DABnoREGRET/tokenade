//
// Spliced by `include!` from `auto.rs`: the same module, so the same
// private access and the same `super::` paths, without a single visibility
// line changed. It is the shape this repo already uses for 33 other modules.
//
// A `//!` is impossible here: a file spliced by `include!` is not a
// module, and an INNER doc comment has nothing to qualify.

// When two compactors can both take the same table, the choice must survive
// one of them declining.
//
// `TabularCli` consults the per-command module first — it knows what the
// table MEANS — and fell back to the generic one only when no module
// existed. A module that answers with the table it was handed is the same
// situation and was not treated as one.
// A patch is a patch whatever language its payload is written in.
//
// Measured 2026-08-26 over the 256 patch files in the corpus: 30 never
// reached the diff compactor, claimed by the detector for their PAYLOAD's
// language — markdown for a README patch, HCL for a TypeScript one, SQL for
// `dist/dev.cjs`.
// Item-level retention: do the facts an agent would need survive the fold?
//
// The shape is borrowed from `alibaba/anolisa`'s L2 retention check, which
// scores a compressor fact-by-fact and NAMES what each one dropped rather
// than returning a single pass/fail. Checked here on the command shapes our
// own corpus shows agents actually run, so a fold that starts eating the
// answer fails on the case that matters rather than on a synthetic one.
