//! Lightweight codebase index: symbols + import graph.
//!
//! Instead of a multi-megabyte tree-sitter grammar set, we use carefully
//! written per-language regexes to extract *declarations* (functions, types,
//! classes) and *imports*. This is the tokensave/codegraph idea (symbol nav +
//! dependency graph, impact radius) delivered with zero heavy deps.
//!
//! The win: an agent asks "where is `parse_config`?" or "what's the impact of
//! changing `User`?" and gets a few hundred tokens of structured answer instead
//! of reading dozens of whole files.

// `Symbol` and `Call` are the records the EXTRACTOR produces; they live with
// it in `treesitter`, and are re-exported here because `index::Symbol` is the
// spelling the whole repo knows.
