//! Consolidated SQLite store for per-project symbol/import-graph
//! indexes.
//!
//! Replaces the per-project `<root>/.tokenade/index.json` file with a
//! single `~/.tokenade/index.db` keyed by project path. Same shape as
//! `semantic_db` (Phase 1: blob storage) — the in-memory `Index`
//! struct is unchanged; only its on-disk layout moves to a global
//! SQLite.
//!
//! Why: previously every project carried a 1–10 MB JSON sidecar.
//! Stale projects accumulated them indefinitely and `tokenade
//! semantic-status` had no visibility into them. The new DB:
//!   * gives `tokenade index-status` a single source of truth
//!   * removes per-project disk noise (one of the four artifacts the
//!     2026-05-29 sweep flagged)
//!   * sets up Phase 2 (relational schema → cross-project symbol
//!     queries server-side)
//!
//! ## Schema
//!
//! ```sql
//! CREATE TABLE project_indexes (
//!     project_path  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
//!     blob          BLOB NOT NULL,   -- JSON-encoded `Index`
//!     last_updated  INTEGER NOT NULL,
//!     size_bytes    INTEGER NOT NULL,
//!     file_count    INTEGER NOT NULL,
//!     symbol_count  INTEGER NOT NULL
//! );
//! ```
