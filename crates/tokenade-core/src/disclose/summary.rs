/// reader sees an image whose description swallows the rest of the document.
/// MEASURED 2026-09-09 on the corpus's 39 pages: two of the ten orphan
/// brackets came from here, the other eight from `markdown::short_preview`.
///
/// The rule shared with `markdown` backs up to before the construct left
/// open. Backing up to a LINE boundary was tried and REMOVED: on
/// `investopedia`, the last line of the head is a section heading followed by
/// its preview, and throwing it away lost the heading — a falling total hid a
/// real loss, a price already paid once before.
///
/// The announced number is what was REALLY removed, recomputed after the cut:
/// the old `total - head_budget - tail_budget` announced the budgets and not the
/// sizes obtained, so it would have lied as soon as the cut backs up.
/// **A preview's tail starts at a LINE, never in the middle of a word.**

/// mid-word — `ch service to …")`, `s the expected type for…`,
/// `w/index.php?title=…&action=edit>)`. The fragment no longer has its section
/// heading, which stayed on the other side of the cut, and so it reads as
/// the continuation of what precedes the banner.
///
/// The symmetry with the HEAD is false, and that is what matters: backing the head up
/// to a line boundary throws away a WHOLE line — on investopedia,
/// a section heading and its preview — and that was removed for this reason.
/// Moving the tail forward only throws away a fragment whose start is ALREADY lost.

    //      reflex first choice on a needle-in-log search.
    // The summary itself is a head+tail (or schema/outline) fold, so we
    // also say plainly that it omits middle lines — grepping the stash
    // preview is a trap.
    // Question-FIRST: a ref is a document you ASK, not a dump handle. Lead with
    // the RAG path (targeted passages, several questions at once), keep grep of
    // the ORIGINAL for exact values, and demote raw bytes to a rarely-needed
    // escape — field data showed agents bare-dumping refs and re-inflating
    // context (107/111 recoveries, up to 30 KB) when a question was what they
    // needed.
    // The COMMAND variant used to send exact lookups back through
    // `tokenade raw <cmd>`, and that command REFUSES the programs whose output
    // is most often stashed: `grep`, `cat`, `sed`, `wc`, `ls`, `find`, `head`,
    // `tail`, `awk` all answer "refusing bypass for `X`" and point back here.
    // So the advice cost a turn to be told to come back. `--grep` is the verb
    // that answers an exact-value question without re-executing anything, and
    // a miss on it NAMES what it searched instead of reading as
    // "never printed" — which is what made grepping a preview a trap before.
    // The FILE variant keeps pointing at the original path: when the source is
    // known, reading it is complete, verbatim and cheaper still.
    // Lead with the SIZE IN TOKENS. The agent is deciding how to spend its
    // context; given the number it picks the right verb by itself (~800 tokens
    // → just read it; ~40k → obviously ask). That does the steering a nudge
    // alone could not, and it is why `--raw` is NOT advertised here: promoting
    // it invites the bare dump we measured 107/111 times. It stays discoverable
    // in `--help` and in the refusal message, where the size is already known.
