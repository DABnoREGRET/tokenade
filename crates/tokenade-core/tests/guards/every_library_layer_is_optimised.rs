//! **A library layer compiles at `opt-level = 3`, not at "z".**
//!
//! This repo's `[profile.release]` optimises for SIZE (`opt-level = "z"`) and
//! raises back to 3, one by one, the crates where the time is spent. The
//! table naming them is hand-written, and it named `tokenade-core` alone —
//! that was true as long as everything lived there.
//!
//! The split carried the hot code into `tk-base`, `tk-fold`, `tk-formats` and
//! `tk-agents`, and the table stayed on the old address: the four layers fell
//! back to the size setting without a test saying so. MEASURED on 2026-09-14
//! on `per_command` (379 fixtures): **58 ms without the four lines, 55 ms
//! with**.
//!
//! The rule is therefore derived from the DIRECTORY, like `crate_srcs`: every
//! `tk-*` crate — plus the `tokenade-core` facade — must have its line. A new
//! layer arrives with its setting, or this guard turns red.
