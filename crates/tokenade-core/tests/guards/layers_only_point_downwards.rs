//! A layer only names what is BELOW it.
//!
//! `tokenade-core` carries 210 modules declared flat in `lib.rs`, all `pub`,
//! hence all reachable from anywhere. Nothing ever stopped a primitive from
//! calling a product layer, and the result is measurable: the 210 modules form
//! ONE strongly connected component of 136 — `platform`, `debug_log` and
//! `paths` are in it, with `gain`, `license`, `web` and `cmd`. As long as it
//! holds, no crate can be extracted: the compiler refuses a cycle between
//! crates.
//!
//! This test is the boundary the language does not give yet. It reads the
//! `crate::<module>` of every file, projects them onto the table below, and
//! refuses any edge that goes UP — except those already there, written one by
//! one in `DEBT` with their number of sites. The debt therefore cannot grow in
//! silence, nor stay written after being paid.
//!
//! Why a DECLARED debt rather than a test that fails right away: 136 sites are
//! not fixed in one commit, and a red test left red guards nothing any more.
//! Counted, it guards the rest while it is being paid.
//!
//! MEASURED, counting only CODE: 69 edges / 116 sites. Counting comments too,
//! it was 122 / 246 before `archetypes` and the table fold left `cmd/` — a
//! third of that gap was prose.
