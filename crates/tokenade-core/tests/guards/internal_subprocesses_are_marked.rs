//! Tokenade's own plumbing is never mistaken for work an agent asked for.
//!
//! `pack` asks `git ls-files` which files exist; `web` asks `curl` for a page;
//! the grep hook runs `rg`; a media read runs `ffprobe`. Tokenade reads all of
//! that ITSELF — none of it reaches an agent. Put any interception layer
//! between tokenade and those programs (the PATH shim shipped before 0.9.5,
//! which the installer removes but an install that never upgraded still
//! carries; a wrapper script; a shell function) and two things go wrong at
//! once. MEASURED 2026-09-04 with such a `git` first on PATH: one `tokenade
//! pack` booked `wrap / git-ls-files 8059 -> 249` plus a `recovery:offered`
//! row — a saving on 2,699 file paths nobody was going to pay for — and pack's
//! own answer came back 57 bytes different, because it had parsed the FOLD
//! instead of the file list.
//!
//! `process_util::internal_command` is the one rule. This sweep is what keeps a
//! new spawn site from quietly opting out of it.
