//! A production file has a readable size, and the list of exceptions
//! shrinks.
//!
//! The rule of this work is: production ≤ ~800 lines per file. It is not
//! held — and a rule no test measures is only an intention. This test does
//! for SIZE what `layers_only_point_downwards` does for edges: it counts, it
//! writes the debt one line per file, and it refuses that it grows.
//!
//! What is counted is the half that SHIPS, through `srcsweep`, not the
//! file's line count. Moving 4,000 lines of `#[cfg(test)]` to a sibling file
//! does not make a module simpler; this test must therefore not reward that
//! move. It counts what the compiler delivers.
//!
//! The sibling file `x_tests.rs` is not counted at all: it only contains
//! tests, its production half is empty, and it does not have to hold the
//! bound.
//!
//! **Nor a GENERATED file.** `cmd/spec_table.rs` carries 3,368 lines and it
//! is the biggest entry of the list — but it is a TABLE, one line per
//! compactor, written by a generator that says at the top "Do not edit by
//! hand" and explains why it is on one line: rustfmt would make it 33,874
//! lines that the next regeneration silently undoes. Splitting it makes no
//! sense, and leaving it in the debt suggested there were 91 god files to
//! split where there are 90. A generated file is recognised by its own
//! header, not by a list written here.
