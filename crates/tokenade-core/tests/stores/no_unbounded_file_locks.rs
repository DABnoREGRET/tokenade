//! No tokenade file lock waits forever.
//!
//! `fs2`'s `lock_exclusive()` blocks with no ceiling. Every call site that had
//! one also discarded its result (`let _ = …`) — a lock error has always meant
//! "carry on" — so the unbounded wait bought nothing, and cost this: in this
//! repository's own suite, with dozens of wrapped commands running at once, a
//! `tokenade wrap` had still not started its work after 30 SECONDS, six times
//! across one session, where the same test alone takes 0.25 s. The savings
//! ledger was bounded first; the stall came back, because a usage
//! reporter, the redaction counter and the recalc marker each held one too —
//! all three on the startup path of EVERY invocation.
//!
//! `platform::lock_briefly` is the one rule. This sweep is what keeps a second
//! spelling from appearing next to it.
