//! Fold lines that are the SAME sentence with one value changed.
//!
//! Byte-equality folding (`<line> (×N)`) is the honest floor, and on real
//! output it almost never fires: a build log does not repeat a line, it repeats
//! a *sentence* — one warning per route, one per file, one per module — with a
//! path or an identifier swapped in. Measured on a real Next.js build: 0.1%
//! saved by exact folding, because no two lines were ever byte-equal.
//!
//! The rule here is deliberately narrow, because the failure mode of template
//! folding is severe: "retained for 400 days" and "retained for 30 days" share
//! a template and mean opposite things. So the varying values are never
//! dropped, only the repeated sentence is:
//!
//! ```text
//!  ⚠ cannot resolve `{}` in "{}"  (×24)
//!    dynamic · /api/a/route
//!    runtime · /api/a/route
//! ```
//!
//! Every value, and every value PAIRING, survives in source order. What is
//! saved is the sentence said 23 extra times.

/// Values are what changes between two instances of the same sentence: quoted
/// strings, backticked identifiers, paths, and numbers.
