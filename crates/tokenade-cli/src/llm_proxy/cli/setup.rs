//! **Install, supervise, start at boot, and remove.**
//!
//! Rank 4 is the only one `tokenade install` does NOT lay down: it is asked
//! for by name, because it can break something. An agent pointed at a proxy
//! that does not answer does not degrade, it refuses.
//!
//! Hence the shape of this file: nothing is declared installed before
//! `confirm_it_serves` has verified it, and removal lives next to install. An
//! installer without its removal leaves a configuration pointing at a missing
//! binary, and the user reads the failure as their agent breaking down.
