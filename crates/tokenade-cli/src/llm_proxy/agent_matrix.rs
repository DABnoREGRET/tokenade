//! What rank 4 should DO in front of each agent — and where it should stay out.
//!
//! The question this module answers is not "can the proxy run", it is "what is
//! MISSING for this agent that only the proxy can supply". They are different
//! questions and the first one is the wrong one: Claude Code is perfectly
//! reachable by a base URL and the proxy must not fold a single byte for it,
//! because its hooks already own every tool result (one authority per payload). Codex is the
//! opposite case — its hook needs an approval click most users never find, so
//! for an un-approved Codex the proxy is the ONLY channel that can report a
//! gain at all.
//!
//! Three measured axes, and the role falls out of them:
//!
//! 1. **Reach** — is there a base URL to change? Measured by reading what the
//!    agent itself ships, never inferred from a neighbour. Windsurf (now
//!    Devin Desktop) is the standing reminder: it was classed by resemblance
//!    with antigravity and the class was wrong for three days.
//! 2. **Wire** — once we are in the path, is the body one of the three we can
//!    rewrite? Being in the path is worth nothing on a proprietary protocol,
//!    and `wire::detect` will correctly refuse to touch it.
//! 3. **Who already carries** — [`tokenade_core::detect::Agent::coverage`].
//!
//! **Every row here was measured on 2026-08-15 against the agent installed on
//! this machine**, by reading the shipped bundle or binary for the environment
//! names and route strings it carries. An agent that is not installed here gets
//! [`Reach::Unmeasured`], and `Unmeasured` never renders as a capability — the
//! empty cell that this whole document prefers to an optimistic one.
//!
//! The limit of that evidence, stated rather than glossed: finding
//! `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` inside an agent's bundle proves the name is in its
//! code, not that the code path is reachable in every mode. In particular an
//! agent talking to a SUBSCRIPTION rather than to an API may ignore it, which
//! is a structural limit of rank 4. Confirming a row costs one run of
//! that agent against a proxy, which is what [`super::server`]'s tests do for
//! the transport and what an operator can do per agent in a minute.
