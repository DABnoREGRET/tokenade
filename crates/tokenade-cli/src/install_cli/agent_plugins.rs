/// hand. Every fix ever made to these files, including redaction correctness,

/// where a prior install is PROVEN. The dropped file is the marker (it is

/// an install the user did not ask for — it only replaces bytes tokenade wrote.
///
/// Registration steps are deliberately NOT re-run. `cline plugin install` and
/// `openclaw plugins install` spawn a process and print to stderr; they belong
/// to an interactive install. What goes stale on upgrade is the file content,
