// What is wired is `tokenade llm-proxy` and nothing else. `tokenade install`
// still does not look for a proxy, start one, or write a base URL anywhere:
// the rungs above install for everybody because they cannot break anything,
// and this one can — a base URL pointing at a proxy that is not running fails
// every turn — so it is asked for by name, per agent.

// ── The command SURFACE, as seen from the dispatcher ───────────────────
//
// These three blocks described `wrap`, `mcp-wrap` and `activate`. They were
// DOCUMENTATION comments hanging in the void — three `///` in a row with no
// item below them, for long enough that the function they described had moved
// elsewhere. A `///` without an item documents nothing and only compiles by
// tolerance; turned into `//`, they say what they always meant to say, at the
// place that dispatches.
//
// `tokenade wrap <shell-cmd>` — run an arbitrary shell command via
// `sh -c`, apply the right per-command compactor to the combined
// stdout/stderr, write the COMPACT result to stdout, the banner to
// stderr, and exit with the underlying command's status code.
//
// The hook installer rewrites Bash tool invocations to call this:
// `Bash(git log -5)` becomes `Bash(tokenade wrap 'git log -5')`.
// Claude Code's UI shows the rewritten command and prints the
// compact output as the tool result — no `permissionDecision: deny`,
// no "Error:" prefix.
//
// This is the SAME architectural pattern RTK uses (its
// `src/hooks/hook_cmd.rs`); the earlier
// deny+reason pattern caused every intercept to surface as "Error:"
// in the Claude Code UI even when the data was fine.
// `tokenade mcp-wrap -- <target-binary> [<target-args>…]` — spawn
// the target MCP server as a child process and stream JSON-RPC
// between it and the agent that launched this proxy. On every
// inbound response (`tools/call` result) we walk the
// `result.content[].text` payloads and run them through
// [`tokenade_core::disclose::maybe_stash`]: anything above the 5 k
// token threshold gets stashed to disk and replaced with a
// structural summary. Errors, notifications, and non-text content
// items are forwarded verbatim.
//
// The proxy is what `tokenade install` rewrites every third-party
// MCP entry to spawn. Each agent boot spawns one proxy per MCP
// server; the proxy exits when its stdin closes.
