"""tokenade <-> Hermes bridge (auto-installed by `tokenade install`).

Pipes large tool results through the tokenade binary for compaction, returning
the smaller version that Hermes then puts in front of the model. Terminal
output is intentionally skipped: tokenade's universal shell proxy already
compacts shell commands before Hermes sees them.

Hook API (verified against NousResearch/hermes-agent, hermes_cli/plugins.py
VALID_HOOKS + model_tools.py invoke): Hermes exposes `transform_tool_result`,
invoked with ALL-KEYWORD args (tool_name=, args=, result=, session_id=, …);
the first callback returning a str replaces the result. Registering an unknown
hook name only WARNS (and pollutes the user's Hermes log every startup), so we
register exactly the one valid name. A per-registration and per-fire marker is
written under the plugin dir so `tokenade doctor` can tell a Hermes user
whether the hook ever actually fired. Nothing here ever raises into the host.

Stdlib-only (subprocess + os + shutil): all real compaction logic lives in the
Rust binary. This file is a thin bridge so the multi-OS surface stays in Rust —
it runs under Hermes' own Python interpreter, which is guaranteed present.

# RESULT string is shell-agnostic — closes the cmd.exe gap. When the shim
# already folded it (Linux / PowerShell), re-running `read` is a harmless no-op
