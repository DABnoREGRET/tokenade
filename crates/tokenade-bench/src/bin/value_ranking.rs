//! It exists because a declared hierarchy is an opinion. This one comes out

//!
//! ## The first ranking was wrong, and its first use showed it
//!
//! It sorted the "expensive and inefficient paths" by bytes still delivered,
//! without relating them to the total. `sysinfo` therefore came first with 59,307
//! uses — and 3,879,492 input bytes, i.e. **65 bytes per call**. The remaining
//! gain there was worth 1.6 MB out of 833 MB saved: 0.2 %. Sorting on an
//! unrelated total over-weights very frequent operations with a tiny load.
//!
//! Corrected, the picture flips: **76 % of everything still delivered comes from
//! TWO operations** (`html-to-markdown` 40.9 %, `auto-compact` 35.0 %), already at
//! −95 % but so voluminous that their residue dominates. Gaining one point on
//! `html-to-markdown` pays more than perfecting `sysinfo` entirely.
//!
//! ## And my own probes must be set aside
//!
//! `a11y-compact` weighed 11.2 % of what was delivered — 5 calls, all on the same day. It is
//! a probe from a past iteration, not usage. The ledger carries
//! `heaviest_day_share`: an operation concentrated on a single day AND little
//! used is noise I made.
