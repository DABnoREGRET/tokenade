//! **What is the residue MADE of?**
//!
//! A rate says how much remains; it never says what. An earlier pass costed by
//! hand what the `npm` compactor left — 102 route lines for 5,826
//! bytes, 20 `.pnpm/` paths for 3,802 — and **19,000 of the 28,649 remaining
//! bytes were attributed to nothing**. An axis you cannot name cannot be
//! worked on, and it does not close either.
//!
//! This census folds a capture through the real entry point
//! (`filter_command`), then groups the RESIDUE lines by SHAPE: the
//! numbers, quoted strings, hashes and paths are replaced by
//! a marker, so two lines that differ only by their values
//! fall into the same group. The report gives the heaviest groups,
//! with an example — a number that cannot be re-read is an opinion.
//!
//! ## WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//!
//! **A single layer.** It calls `filter_command`, which is the command
//! compactor — and the agent receives the result of a SECOND layer
//! (`disclose::build_summary`) that cuts a middle again. The two
//! interact: one change folded 3,569 bytes here and the next measured, on
//! the delivery path, that the output GREW from 16,122 to 20,397 bytes
//! — removing lines at the first layer takes the document below the threshold
//! of the second, which then stops cutting.
//!
//! So: by default this report names targets, it does not cost a gain.
//!
//! **`--delivered` takes the number from BOTH layers**, by running the real CLI
//! (`tokenade filter --deliver <prog>` on standard input) with an isolated
//! state. It is the only number one is allowed to put in a patch note,
//! and the instrument those changes were missing: without it, a first-layer
//! fold is judged on a quantity the agent never receives.
//!
//! Yet it lost it for eight iterations. It was first obtained through
//! `wrap "cat <capture>"`; a later fix corrected that routing — it measured the
//! `cat` compactor — by going through `filter <prog>`, which has only ONE layer.
//! A correct fix took away a capability, and this comment kept
//! announcing two layers. The report's sentence now comes from the path
//! actually taken (`Stages::banner`), not from here. `--one-stage` returns the old
//! number, for whoever wants to see the gap between the two.
//!
//! `cargo run -q -p tokenade-bench --bin residue_census [--fixture <key>] [--limit N]
//!  [--delivered [--one-stage]] [--verbatim]`
//!
//! Without `--fixture`, it surveys ALL command captures and ranks the
//! shapes by remaining bytes, all compactors combined.
