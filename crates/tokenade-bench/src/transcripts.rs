//! **Does a fold send the agent looking for what it removed?**
//!
//! All the ratchets in this repo measure the TEXT — fidelity, needles
//! found, fabrications. None measures the CONSEQUENCE: does the agent that receives
//! the folded output then do the right thing, or does it retrace its steps?
//!
//! The question is not answered by reading markdown. It is answered by reading
//! what the agent DID afterwards, and that trace exists: the Claude Code
//! transcripts, `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`. **758 files, 1.3 GB, 37
//! projects** on the measuring machine as of 2026-09-11 — real sessions, on
//! real repos, most of which are not this one.
//!
//! **The joinable signal, and why it is exact.** Each fold prints a
//! banner carrying a HASH (`tokenade expand-ref a09ff10b5d8a`). When the agent
//! is not satisfied with it, it runs `tokenade expand-ref <that hash>`. The hash JOINS
//! both ends: we know which fold, precisely, sent the agent looking —
//! and the banner also names the FAMILY that produced it (`[tokenade:said-once]`,
//! `[disclose:summary kind=md]`, `[tokenade:template-fold]`…). The return rate
//! PER FAMILY can therefore be computed, and it is what says which fold costs the
//! agent rather than making it gain.
//!
//! **What this rate is NOT.** `expand-ref` is the intended recovery
//! path; taking it proves that it works, not that there is a fault. A high
//! rate on a family says that this family folds what the agent needs —
//! nothing more, and that is already a lot. The truly costly case, where
//! the agent does NOT come back and carries on with amputated information, leaves no
//! such trace: it will take another signal, and it is written here so as not to
//! confuse the two.
